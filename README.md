# Standalone-CNC-Machine-Build
Built a 2-axis CNC machine using Arduino Uno and CNC shield with DRV8825 drivers. Used a Raspberry Pi Pico to send stored G-code to the Arduino, eliminating the need for a PC. Added limit switches for homing, custom GRBL pin configurations, and a relay-controlled heated bed for special materials.
